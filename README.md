target=_blank
=============

What do I believe in?
-----------------------

 - *a)* all external links should open in new windows.  
   I know, right?! I don't want to lose context just to go look at some other content for a minute! I'll load up target_external.user.js

 - *b)* links should always open in the current window unless I middle-click.
   Tell me about it, target=_blank just leads to annoying window clutter I'll have to clean up later! I'll load up target_clear.user.js

How do I load what I believe in?

Just drag your sacred user.js file onto your browser* and accept the confirmation prompts. As long as your browser is Chrome, or you have a Greasemonkey or equivalent extension installed...
